# Badminton Skill Calculator

This is for learing purpose for my own software development skills.
Not specifical meant for Badminton but I will use it to handle various badminton tournaments and competitions I take part in.

I'm using some basic ELO calculations setup to learn more about how ELO raking works and how best to implement it for my situation.

## ELO Ranking Logic

Still under investigation, need additional development for first level on real world implementation. After that I can learn more on how to implement the ELO calculations and impementation for our usecase. More details will follow here.

## Future Development

The various development topics are no specific order. 

There is no planned deadline for any of the features. I'll work on it when I have time and enthusiasm for it.

### Near Future

- Import game results(data) from Excel and/or other spreadsheets(eg. Google docs) IN PROGRESS
- Store data of scanned tournaments in DB and keep track of ELO over time without having to reimport and calculate all data over again.
- Generate some kind of HTML for static website content in case it's interesting for other compeditors.
- Add ELO confidence value and use it to handle ELO gain/loss.
- Various minor improvements in codes marked with TODO

### Far Future

- Import game results(data) from Tournamentsoftare.com competition results, some webscraping probably needed.

## Not in Scope

-To handle individual players ranking and how they play in different categories. This is just basic 

## For Learning

I might also write this project, with potentially limited scope, in other languages for learing purpose.
